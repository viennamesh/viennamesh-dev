     * branch is expected NOT to be taken. The following 'mov' instruction is
     * called "branch delayed instruction" and is executed TOGETHER with the
     * preceeding branch instruction; we take advantage of this "instruction
     * slot" to copy the updated value of the shared variable from %0 to %g1
     * where it is expected to be found by the 'add'.
